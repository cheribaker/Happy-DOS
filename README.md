# Happy-DOS
A modified DOS watchface for Watchy with battery indicator, step counter, and date.

Happy DOS is based on the DOS watchface hosted here: https://github.com/sqfmi/Watchy

**Additional Features:**
- The "Version Number" shows your Watchy's battery level, in volts.
- The "# files and # bytes" shows the current month and day.
- The "<C:\>" shows the current day of the week.
- The "# bytes free" shows your steps for the day, and the step counter resets at 12:01am

Shout out to BrainInABowl for the snippet of code that resets the step counter. Source: https://github.com/BraininaBowl/Bahn-for-Watchy
